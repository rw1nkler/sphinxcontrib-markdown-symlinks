# Internal Link Test

This test consists of a link to the markdown file, already used in
the Sphinx documentation. In this case, the Markdown Symlinks extension
should change the link used in this file to the file inside the documentation.

If this link works in the Sphinx documentation, the Markdown Symlinks
extension correctly resolved the link reference:

[Link to the file](test_files/int_file.md)
