# External Link Test

This test contains a link to the markdown file that is not used in
the Sphinx documentation. Therefore, after creating the symbolic link
to this test in Sphinx documentation, the Markdown Symlinks should change
the link inside this file to the Github URL.

If this link works in the Sphinx documentation, the Markdown Symlinks
extension correctly resolved the link reference:

[Link to the file](file.md)
